Based on best practice recommendations, Digital Object Identifiers (DOI) based persistent identifiers are implemented in MOSDAC. The digital object identifier [DOI®] system provides an infrastructure for persistent unique identification of objects of any type. DOI is an acronym for \"digital object identifier\", meaning a \"digital identifier of an object\". The DOI system is designed to work over the Internet. A DOI name is permanently assigned to an object to provide a resolvable persistent network link to current information about that object, including where the object, or information about it, can be found on the Internet. While information about an object can change over time, its DOI name will not change.\nDOI based Persistent Identifiers provide following advantages:\nPersistent citations in scholarly materials, this will help end users to retrieve metadata and data from the link available in the metadata.\nLong term actionable reference for satellite images, this will enable discovery and re-use.\nAdvantages of Acquiring DOI at SAC Level:\nAllow all Digital objects belonging to SAC under one DOI naming convention.\nStandardization among different entities of SAC for assigning persistent identifiers.\nDOI acquired for MOSDAC Products\nare available under CATALOG->Satellite Products"

Mesoscale oceanic eddies have been identified and tracked in weekly merged altimeter product of Sea Surface Height (SSH) from AVISO. Eddies have been identified based on closed contour approach followed by shape criteria. An automated tracking algorithm has been employed to track these eddies with different lifetime. The trajectories of eddies have been computed from their time history. Present method has been used separately for cold core and warm core eddies.

The radar reflectivity has been corrected for clutter using a combination of a spatial continuity filter and a fuzzy-logic based echo classification algorithm. The velocity folded regions are dealiased using a 2D multipass velocity dealiasing algorithm. The corrected reflectivity and radial velocity are then gridded into 1 km x 1 km x 250 m 3D volumetric grid which can be used by scientists for further meteorological applications.

It carries a Ka band single frequency satellite altimeter (AltiKa). Satellite altimeters are primarily used to study sea level changes. In the open ocean, the altimetric echo follows a standard shape, with steeply rising leading edge followed by a trailing edge with gradually diminishing power. This standard shape is in agreement with the theoretical Brown model and hence can be easily modeled. However, in the coastal areas, due to the presence of land and other coastal featues in the footprint of the altimeter, contamination occurs and the return is different from open ocean. Up to some extent these contaminations can be modeled. Footprint size of SARAL/Altika is small which is ideal for coastal studies. The available ocean retracker (MLE4) itself shows good performance near the coast. However, further improvemnts can be achieved by using algorithms which can simulate contaminations impact in the coastal areas. In this document we have used various models for the return waveforms at 40 Hz to extract maximum information from the altimeter. Our results show that algorithms which are useful in the coastal areas are BETA5, BETA9 and Brown with Asymmetric Gaussian Peak (BAGP). Additionally, a wind power and wave power product has also been generated from this coastal product.\n7\nDataset Contact\nAditya Chaudhary, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad 380015,\naditya.osd@sac.isro.gov.in\n8\nUpdate frequency\n35 cycles of SARAL/AltiKa have been processed.

The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system (ISAS) climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum.

User should refer doi:10.1175/JPO-D-12-0204.1.\nLimitations\nThis method is only applicable in a region where the Coriolis parameter does not change abruptly. Also it is not applicable on the equator.\nVertical movement is ignored in isQG framework.\nisQG method works well when the eddy kinetic energy (EKE) is low. If EKE is large, it will fail to generate accurate subsurface fields.\nWe considered the Barotropic and the first Baroclinic modes only in our analysis. This certainly limits our approach.\nThis method generates less satisfactory subsurface fields if the stratification is strong.\nThe vertical resolution in our case is 10 m. This is a major drawback since in Bay of Bengal, the mixed layer can be as shallow as 15-20 m.\nKnown problems with data\nData problems due to bad weather (heavy rain) and extreme events like cyclones etc.\nFile Naming Conventio\nn\nNetcdf file: isQG_yyyy.nc\nMetaData\nSr. No\nCore Metadata Elements\nDefinition\n1\nMetadata language\nEnglish\n2\nMetadata Contact\nMOSDAC\n3\nMetadata date\nMay, 2018\n4\nData Lineage or Quality\nSea surface height anomaly, Sea surface density anomaly in Bay of Bengal using isQG methodology.\n5\nTitle\nReconstruction of Ocean interior density and horizontal velocity anomaly ﬁelds using Satellite data in Bay of Bengal\n6\nAbstract\nSatellite data has been used to reconstruct ocean interior density and velocity anomalies in the Bay of Bengal through the “interior + surface Quasigeostrophic” (isQG) method. The inputs are sea surface height anomaly (AVISO), sea surface density anomaly; which is calculated using GHRSST sea surface temperature and SMAP sea surface salinity. One more input is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, calculated from in-situ analysis system (ISAS) climatological data. The results show that isQG retrieved subsurface density anomalies are very promising compared to RAMA buoy data in the cold season when EKE is minimum. Validation of retrieved density has also been performed using ARGO data which reveals that isQG is more promising when the stratification is weak .\n7\nDataset Contact\nAnup Kumar Mandal, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015,\nanupmandal@sac.isro.gov.in\n8\nUpdate Frequency\nSix months.\n9\nAccess Rights or Restriction\nOpen Access\n10\nSpatial Resolution\nSpatial resolution is 25 km, while vertical resolution is 10m\n11\nLanguage\nEnglish\n12\nTopic Category\nOcean subsurface product (SAMUDRA Project) using satellite data.\n13\nKeywords\nDensity anomaly, Velocity anomaly, subsurface fields, 3D-Ocean fields\n14\nDate or period\nJanuary 2017 - till date\n15\nResponsible Party\nAnup Kumar Mandal,OSD/AOGG/ EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India\n16\nOrganization\nSpace Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, India\n16a\nOrg. role\nGeophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region.\n16b\nIndividual name\nAnup Kumar Mandal, OSD/AOSG/EPSA, SAC (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India.

Nine of the twelve normal C-band transponders provide expanded coverage and the remaining three have India coverage beam. All the extended C-band as well as the Ku-band transponders has India coverage beams. INSAT-3A also carries a Ku-band beacon. For meteorological observation, INSAT-3A carries a three channel Very High Resolution Radiometer (VHRR) with 2 km resolution in the visible band and 8 km resolution in thermal infrared and water vapour bands. In addition, INSAT-3A carries a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) camera which operates in the visible and short wave infrared bands providing a spatial resolution of 1 km. A Data Relay Transponder (DRT) operating in UHF band is incorporated for realtime hydro-meteorological data collection from unattended platforms located on land and river basins. The data is then relayed in extended C-band to a central location. INSAT-3A also carries another transponder for Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS & R) as part of India's contribution to the international Satellite Aided Search and Rescue programme. INSAT-3A was launched by European Ariane-5G Launch Vehicle into a Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO) with a perigee of 200 km and an apogee of 35,980 km. The satellite is maneuvered to its final orbit by firing the satellite's apogee motor. Subsequently, the deployment of solar array, antennae and the solar sail is carried out and the satellite is commissioned after in-orbit checkout.\nहिन्दी"

The main objective of this mission is to understand the life cycle of convective systems that influence the tropical weather and climate and their role in associated energy and moisture budget of the atmosphere in tropical regions. Megha-Tropiques provides scientific data on the contribution of the water cycle to the tropical atmosphere, with information on condensed water in clouds, water vapour in the atmosphere, precipitation, and evaporation. With its circular orbit inclined 20 deg to the equator, the Megha-Tropiques is a unique satellite for climate research that should also aid scientists seeking to refine prediction models. The Megha-Tropiques has day, night and all-weather viewing capabilities; it passes over India almost a dozen times every day, giving scientists an almost real- time assessment of the evolution of clouds.\nहिन्दी"

    "content": "SARAL-AltiKa\nSARAL mission results from the common interest of both CNES and ISRO in studying ocean from space using altimetry system and in promoting maximum use of the ARGOS Data Collecting System. Radar altimetry by satellite is a technique used in oceanography to measure, globally over the oceans, the sea level needed to understand ocean circulation and its variability. The importance of altimetry data to better understand the ocean circulation and its impact on the climate of the Earth led to the TOPEX/Poseidon and Jason series of satellites complemented by ERS1-2, GFO and ENVISAT. With the launch of these missions began a data collection that must continue well into the century in order to monitor the inter-annual evolution and separate transient phenomena from secular variations. SARAL/AltiKa mission belongs to the global altimetry system and then participates to the precise and accurate observations of ocean circulation and sea surface elevation for its life time. Thus it is the aim of AltiKa part of the SARAL mission to provide altimetric measurements designed to study ocean circulation and sea surface elevation with the same accuracy as the one provided by ENVISAT mission and complementary to Jasons mission. The AltiKa project developed by CNES is based on a large Ka-band altimeter (35.75 GHz, 500MHz), 1st oceanographic altimeter using such a high frequency. The use of the Ka-band frequency will supply more accurate measurements (improvement of the spatial and vertical resolution) enabling a better observation of ices, coastal areas, continental water bodies as well as the waves height. The drawback of this Ka-band frequency is its sensitivity to rain that can lead to signal attenuation. The SARAL/AltiKa mission is part of the operational satellite altimetry system, jointly with Jason-2, and enables to ensure the service continuity which is nowadays provided by ENVISAT altimeter jointly with Jason-2 and Jason-1. By ensuring the observations continuity and widening the observation areas, CNES answers the wish of the oceanography community by bringing a description: For the meso-scale in open ocean,, In coastal areas, For the seasonal forecast, For the hydrology, For the climate studies. AltiKa data will thus contribute, along with data from others altimetry missions, to the development of operational oceanography, to our climate understanding and to the development of forecasting capabilities through data assimilation methods improvement in coupled oceanatmosphere coupling models, bio-chemistry models, etc\nहिन्दी"

This is achieved through the utilization of Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) data derived from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, in conjunction with sea surface currents obtained from altimetry. By employing forward and backward schemes for the numerical advection of SMAP SSS fields using altimeter-derived geostrophic currents, a Lagrangian reconstruction is produced, capturing smaller-scale features. The reliability of our in-house developed algorithm is assessed by comparing it with an available reconstructed product in the Gulf Stream. Additionally, a preliminary validation is conducted against insitu data obtained from a thermo-salinograph. Further, the developed algorithm was modified to select the advection time dynamically.\n7\nDataset Contact\nJai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, 380015,\nkumarj@sac.isro.gov.in\n8\nUpdate Frequency\nSix months.\n9\nAccess Rights or Restriction\nOpen Access\n10\nSpatial Resolution\nSpatial resolution is 10 km\n11\nLanguage\nEnglish\n12\nTopic Category\nHigh resolution sea surface salinity product (SAC-TDP) using satellite data.\n13\nKeywords\nSea surface salinity, sea surface currents, Lagrangian advection technique, high resolution\n14\nDate or period\nApril 2015 - June 2023\n15\nResponsible Party\nJai Kumar, POD/AOGG/ EPSA, Space Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India\n16\nOrganization\nSpace Applications Centre (ISRO), Ahmedabad, India\n16a\nOrg. role\nGeophysical parameters from satellite data in the Bay of Bengal region.\n16b\nIndividual name\nJai Kumar, POD/AOSG/EPSA, SAC (ISRO), Ahmedabad-380015, India.

This satellite is developed out of a small I-1000 bus made of carbon fibre re-enforced plastic light weight structure, a uni power bus employing an 18AH Ni-Cd battery and a single GaAs/Ge solar panel generating 640 watts of power. Metsat uses a 3-axis stabilized momentum biased attitude control system with suitable linearly controlled magnetic torquers for solar radiation pressure compensation. A unified propulsion system of bi-propellant apogee motor of 440 Newtons and the reaction control engines of 22 Newtons has been selected for efficient and versatile mission management.\nMetsat carries on-board a Very High ResolutionRadiometer (VHRR) and a Data Relay Transponder (DRT) for weather data transmission. VHRR provides earth imageries in visible band with a resolution of2 km, in thermal infrared and water vapor bands with 8 km. DRT collects weather data from un-attended data collection platforms located throughout India and transmits the same to centrally located Meteorological Data Utilisation Centre. The satellite dry mass is about 495 kg. Metsat was launched on- board upgraded and modified satellite launch vehicle (PSLV) with a lift–off mass of 1060 kgs in September 2002. After successful launch and early orbit operations and in orbit characterization of the Payload, the satellite has been commissioned for routine usage of weather data and imageries.\nहिन्दी"

The methodology presented by Bonjean and Lagerloef, (2002) is used to derive ocean surface current by combining the geostrophic component from altimeter data and the ageostrophic component from scatterometer and radiometer data. The method of deriving the surface current is based on the resolution of quasi-steady quasi-linear momentum equations, neglecting local acceleration.

After solving for the shear profiles, one can find an expression for the velocity at the surface, which is\nif\nU\n0\n= -g ∇ζ + (1/H ) q(H/h\ne\n)τ + ((H/2)/q(H/2he))∇θ\n(4)\nHere the function q is defined by q (x) = x /tanh (x) and h\ne\n= (A/if )\n1/2\nis complex and its modulus is proportional to the Ekman depth h\ne\n= sqrt( 2A/|f|).\nUsing equation (4) and the datasets mentioned above, the daily ocean surface currents were generated. Equatorial velocities (±3° latitude band) are obtained by solving a weak formulation of the momentum equations using a basis set of orthogonal polynomials as described in Bonjean and Lagerloef (2002).\nLimitations\nAs the equatorial currents are estimated through an approximation procedure using polynomial coefficients the correlation with in-situ currents in the equatorial region is observed to be relatively poorer especially for the meridional currents.\nKnown problems with data\nAs these input satellite data are not very reliable near to the coast, the estimated currents very near to the coast may also have problems.\nRelated data collections\nOSCAR Currents: Bonjean, F, and G.
